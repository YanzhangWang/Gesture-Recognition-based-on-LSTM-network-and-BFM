# [ -G rotate_seconds ] If specified, rotates the dump file specified with the -w option every rotate_seconds seconds. 
# [ -C file_size ] Before writing a raw packet to a savefile, check whether the file is currently larger than file_size and, if so, close the current savefile and open a new one. Savefiles after the first savefile will have the name specified with the -w flag, with a number after it, starting at 1 and continuing upward
# [ -W filecount ] Used in conjunction with the -C option, this will limit the number of files created to the specified number, and begin overwriting files from the beginning, thus creating a 'rotating' buffer. In addition, it will name the files with enough leading 0s to support the maximum number of files, allowing them to sort correctly.
# [ -K ] Don't attempt to verify IP, TCP, or UDP checksums. 
# [ -n ] Don't convert host addresses to names. This can be used to avoid DNS lookups.
